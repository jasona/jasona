# 👋 Hi, I'm Jason

### CEO by day, .NET migration warrior by night, motorcycle comparison enthusiast on weekends

```csharp
public class Jason : ICEOWhoActuallyCodes
{
    private readonly Coffee _fuel = new Coffee(Size.Venti, Shots.Quad);
    private readonly string _currentMission = "Dragging legacy PHP into the promised land of .NET";
    
    public string CurrentStatus => "Converting 15 years of technical debt into technical credit";
}
```

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 🏗️ **Leading the Great Migration™** - Taking Mortgage Automator from PHP to .NET (because apparently I enjoy pain)
- 💰 **Fixing PE-backed Tech Companies** - Helping teardown and rebuild tech-companies for PE companies (it's more exciting than it sounds, I promise)
- 🤖 **AI Tool Showdown Champion** - Currently in a polyamorous relationship with Cursor, Claude, and Amp
- 🖥️ **KVM Enthusiast** - Because why have one computer when your Dell U4025QW can handle two?
- 📝 **Crafting the Perfect Job Posts** - "We're looking for a CTO who can spell Kubernetes and isn't afraid of legacy code"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

```javascript
const techStack = {
    migrating_from: ["PHP", "Technical Debt", "Sleepless Nights"],
    migrating_to: ["C#", ".NET", "Modern Architecture", "Slightly Less Sleepless Nights"],
    exploring: ["Model Context Protocol", "AI-Assisted Coding", "Whatever makes developers 10x"],
    testing_with: ["JUnit", "VSCode Coverage Tools", "Production (just kidding... mostly)"],
    life_optimization: ["Conway's Game of Life", "Map-Reduce Algorithms", "Slack Channel Naming Conventions"]
};
```

## 🎯 Current Side Quests

- 🏍️ Debating whether the Indian Challenger or Triumph Rocket 3 has better torque curves (it's research, okay?)
- ♈ Using astrology to optimize team compatibility (Aries energy in the C-suite)
- ☕ Writing poetic odes to caffeine between code reviews
- 🇨🇦🇺🇸 Navigating cross-border employment law (because nothing says "fun" like international tax implications)
